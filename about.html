  <p>WHO AM I?</p>

  <p>
    For starters, my name is Czar Paolo Capacite, 21 years of age, living in Pamacsalan, Pilar, Bohol.
    I’m not very much of an interactive type of person, especially in front of a stranger since I’m not an expert in starting a conversation, let alone bring up any interesting topics along the way. I tend to easily get attached to people I get to know more though.
    My guiding principle is simple, "just trust the process". If you work hard on something and give your best, trust the outcome whether it's good or bad. Success means your hard work has paid off, and even if it's a bad outcome, you can use that mistake to grow better as a person.
    Some of my accomplishments include being the first honored student in elementary school in Eastern Samar twice, learning how to play guitar in tenth grade, and winning first place in a scavenger hunt contest.
    My dream is simple - for me and my family to live a normal happy life. To accomplish that, I must stay committed to my current course until graduation.
